# Product

<!-- impeccable:product-schema 1 -->

## Platform

web

## Stack

Currently zero-dependency vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, openable from `file://` with no build.
**The user has approved moving to a build step** (npm + Vite + Three.js) to enable real 3D
and modern tooling, accepting the loss of double-click-to-open. Existing content layers
(`content/*.json`, `content/*.css`, the SVG primitive library) carry forward.

## Users

Four real audiences, confirmed by the user, in the same artifact:

1. **The author, upskilling.** Self-directed learning of a hard technical topic, in sessions
   of his own choosing. The original and primary use.
2. **Friends and colleagues**, sent a link to broaden their knowledge. They arrive cold,
   with no obligation to stay, and no one is grading them.
3. **New joiners at the author's company**, if the company adopts it as teaching material.
   Structured, sequential, expected to be completed.
4. **Portfolio viewers** evaluating the author's work. They judge the artifact itself as
   evidence of capability, often in under a minute.

Audience 2 sets the engagement bar (nothing compels them to stay) and audience 4 sets the
craft bar (the platform *is* the work sample). Audiences 1 and 3 are served by anything
that satisfies those two.

## Product Purpose

Teach one deep technical topic — currently flight dynamics — so visually and so
concretely that a complete beginner both understands it and *wants to keep going*. Success
is a learner voluntarily reaching the end of a lesson they had no obligation to start, and
being able to apply the idea rather than recite it.

The user's own diagnosis of the current build is the brief: it reads like a well-typeset
book, and "not much different from picking up a book and learning" is failure.

## Positioning

Three things a neighbouring product could not truthfully copy:

- **Misconception-first.** Every lesson names the wrong mental model out loud and kills it
  deliberately. Most material quietly presents the correct version and leaves the reader's
  existing error intact.
- **Every technical figure is authored, never generated.** Hand-built SVG on a semantic
  colour system, stepped through in stages. Generated imagery is confined to atmosphere and
  is forbidden from carrying facts.
- **Apply, don't recite.** Learners take a concept into an interactive sandbox and make it
  happen, rather than answering a question about it.

## Operating Context

Self-paced, no deadline, no instructor, no cohort. Sessions are voluntary and can be
abandoned at any moment with zero cost — which is the central design pressure. Desktop-first
in practice, but shared links get opened on phones. Read in one sitting per lesson, roughly
10–40 minutes. No login, no account, no server.

## Capabilities and Constraints

**Built and working:** 12 lessons in a deliberate order; 30 hand-authored SVG figures with
2–4 progressive states each; 12 generated hero images; 34 hand-curated videos (from 191 API
candidates, each with a written rationale); 12 comprehension checks; localStorage progress;
light/dark theming from a semantic token layer.

**Confirmed scope for this pass:** one genuinely working Three.js sandbox, on the single
lesson best suited to it, rather than twelve shallow ones. The pattern's real cost is
learned before it is committed to across the set.

**Constraints that must survive:** the semantic colour system (colour carries meaning, and
generated art uses a deliberately separate palette so decoration is never mistaken for
data); the authored-versus-generated boundary; no backend, no accounts, no user data.

**Topic is not fixed.** Flight dynamics is the first subject, not the product. Structure
should not hard-code aviation.

## Brand Commitments

None pre-existing. No logo, no company, no established voice to honour. The written voice
in the current lessons — direct, concrete, willing to say something is wrong — was well
received and is worth preserving.

## Evidence on Hand

- `public/img/*.png` — 12 hero images, provenance in `content/assets.md`
- `src/data/diagrams.js` + `src/data/svg.js` — 30 figures on a semantic primitive layer
- `content/videos.json` — 191 candidates, 34 picked with written rationale
- `content/visual-grammar.md` — the figure contract, proven against 30 real figures
- `content/concepts.json` — the curriculum spine
- `TOOLING-RESEARCH.md` — the original toolchain survey

No testimonials, no usage data, no benchmarks, no customers. None may be fabricated.

## Product Principles

1. **Voluntary attention is the only currency.** Nothing obliges audience 2 to stay. Every
   screen either earns the next minute or loses it.
2. **The misconception is the lesson.** Naming the wrong model explicitly outperforms
   quietly presenting the right one.
3. **Facts are authored; atmosphere is generated.** A confidently wrong figure is worse
   than no figure, and this line is enforced structurally rather than by discipline.
4. **Applying beats answering.** Understanding is demonstrated by making something happen,
   not by selecting the right option.
5. **The artifact is the proof.** For audience 4 the craft *is* the argument, so quality of
   execution is a product requirement, not polish.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

No formal standard imposed by a stakeholder, but the incumbent build already ships
`prefers-reduced-motion` handling, `<title>`/`<desc>` on every figure, real selectable text
in SVG, and theme support. These are treated as a floor to maintain, not achievements to
trade away for visual ambition.
