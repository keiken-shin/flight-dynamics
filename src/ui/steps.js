/* What a chapter asks of you before it counts as complete, and how much of it
 * you have done.
 *
 * It lives in one place because three surfaces need the same answer and must
 * not drift: the chapter shows the list, the index counts it, and the checkride
 * warns on it. It is derived from the content rather than declared — a chapter
 * with no clip does not ask you to watch one — so adding a chapter cannot
 * forget to state its requirements.
 *
 * The requirements are deliberately visible in the chapter itself. A progress
 * bar that fills for reasons the reader cannot see is a slot machine; if
 * finishing a chapter takes three specific things, the page has to say so.
