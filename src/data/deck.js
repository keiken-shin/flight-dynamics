/* The revision deck, DERIVED from the lessons rather than authored beside them.
 *
 * A hand-written deck drifts. Six months after someone corrects a lesson, the
 * card still teaches the old thing, and nobody notices because the two live in
 * different files. So there is no card content in here at all — only rules for
 * turning what a chapter already says into something you can be asked.
 *
 * Three sources, and each earns its place:
 *   MISCONCEPTION  the twelve claims the course exists to kill. The best cards
 *                  in the deck, and the reason to have a deck at all.
 *   FORMULA        already carries a plain-English reading and a term key.
 *   RECALL         the stage-check questions, which are already written to
 *                  target the misconception rather than the prose.
